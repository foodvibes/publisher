      <h2 class="booze-and-blade"><span>Good Food</span> &amp; <span>Strong Drink</span></h2>
      <p><a href="http://foodvib.es">foodvib.es</a> is a refreshingly terse catalogue of simple, familiar recipes. Many were originally shared by someone only to be lost in time and translation; others found in literature only to be unapologetically butchered beyond recognition. It always begins with good intentions and genuine inspiration. What you will find here are the eventual, occasional, serendipitous discoveries born of poor memory, tidal laziness, limited resources and gastrally induced desperation paired with a palate tolerable of failure and relentless will to cook.</p>

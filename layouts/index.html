      <h2 class="booze-and-blade">Good Food. Strong Drink.</h2>
      <p><a href="http://foodvib.es">foodvib.es</a> is a refreshingly terse catalogue of simple, familiar recipes. Many were shared by someone only to be lost in time and translation; others found in literature only to be unapologetically butchered beyond recognition. It always begins with good intentions and genuine inspiration. What you will find here are the ultimate, serendipitous discoveries born of poor memory, tidal laziness, limited resources and gastrally induced desperation paired with a palate tolerable of failure and relentless will to cook.</p>

      <h2 class="book">Inspired by West Coast &amp; Island Lifestyles</h2>
      <p>The book is a beautiful physical manifestation of this. A mashup of fresh flavors and casual culinary style native to west coast and island lifestyles. Everything contained has been crafted between California and Hawai ªi over the last decade. Each recipe inspired by spontaneous happenings, ritual gatherings, casual  dining, backyard barbecues, bonfires at the beach and campfires under the stars with friends, family and amicable strangers.</p>
